# An_Emergemcy_Care_for_Road_Accident
The principal objective of the Emergency Care for Road Accidents project is to help the citizens by using their own smartphonesâ€™ in-built sensors to report road accidents. The ECRA user system will identify the location with the support of in-built sensors in the Smartphone. It will alert the nearest police station with accident coordinates and shows hospitals nearby your location for getting medical assistance. After receiving an alert from ECRA, police will be able to arrive at the scene more quickly and do their jobs more effectively.  This web application works with Mobile Data / Wi-Fi and also user needs to activate the Location / GPS Settings for getting the accurate point on the Map.
